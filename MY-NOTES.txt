The main all we worked on is the indecision app. It's
in the subdirectory.

To start the server go to the indecision-app directory and run

yarn serve   # starts our live-server
yarn build   # starts webpack, which runs babel, which is the service
             # that converts ES6/7 into ES5 for the browser.

yarn add validator@8.0.0   # This adds a dependency to your package.json
                           # file and adds the module to your node_modules
                           # directory
