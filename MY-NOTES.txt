The main all we worked on is the indecision app. It's
in the subdirectory.

To run any client side stuff you need a server running
and a javascript compiler which can convert the ES6/ES7
code into ES5 which the browsers can handle.

In the indecisionApp directory you will find two scripts.
start-server.sh just starts a simple web server which runs
on port 8080.
start-babel.sh is a script which runs a compiler. You need
to pay attention in there what directory it will look in
for compiling and where it will put the result.
